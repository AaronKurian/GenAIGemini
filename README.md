# GenAi Gemini

GenAi Gemini is an AI-powered application that leverages the Gemini API to generate responses based on user input. This project demonstrates how to integrate generative AI into a Next.js application to provide dynamic responses.

## Features

- Generative AI Responses: Uses Google's Gemini API to generate intelligent responses.
- Responsive Design: Built with Next.js, ensuring fast and optimized performance across devices.
- Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the AI model by entering text and receiving context-aware answers.

## Deployment
This project is deployed on Vercel. You can view the live application at [GenAIGemini](https://gen-ai-gemini.vercel.app/).

## Installation

## How it Works

- User Input: The user enters a query or prompt.
- AI Interaction: The prompt is sent to the Gemini API.
- Response Generation: The Gemini model processes the input and generates a response.
- Display Output: The generated response is displayed on the user interface.
